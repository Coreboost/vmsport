               Introducing HBL, the Horse Betting Language
               ===========================================
The Horse Betting Language is a proposed language for defining executable test
specifications for the betting system. This file is both a description of HBL
and an example of what a test specification written in HBL can look like.

A multi-line comment, like this one, can be inserted by having at least three
hyphens on a line. Note that you cannot have anything before or after the
hyphens. Note the full line with hyphens that is before and after the text you
currently are reading. That is what makes this a comment.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- In addition to multi-line comments you can have single line comments that
-- last through the end of the line. Single line comments can start anywhere on
-- the line, i.e., you can have keywords, definitions or similar in the
-- beginning of the line followed by a comment.

                           Concepts
                           ========
There are a number of concepts that are supported directly in HBL that allows
you to, in a compact and a for the domain natural way, define test data and test
scenarios. The following are the most important concepts in HBL.

Accounts
Defines betting accounts that can be used to place bets and the funds available
for betting.

Horses
Defines identity of horses that can race. A rank can optionally be defined for a
horse which is used in the lack of reserves selected by the better.

Tracks
Defines what tracks exists.

Race calendar
Defines the racing calendar, i.e., which races that will take place at which
tracks, the number of legs, horses in each race and how different types of
betting pools are mapped to the different races.

Race days
Defines, for a particular race day, what bets that are made, and what the
results where for each leg. You can also define checks, i.e., this Defines
whether a particular test passes or fails. Bets and results will be applied in
strict order but you cannot specify, for example, the exact time a bet is made
nor the specific time that a result becomes official. You can, however mix Bets,
Results, and Checks freely. Any bet that is made at an illegal point in time
(i.e. a bet on V5 after the first leg) is caught by the HBL validator.

Note that the order is significant in that you always must structure things in
the order Accounts, Horses, Tracks, Race calendar, Race days

              Structuring your test specification with Include
              ================================================
Typically when you write test specifications you will find that you want to
use the same accounts, same horses and so on in different test specifications.
To help with this you can put, for example, your account definitions in a
separate file and include them in different test specificiations with the
Include directive.

It looks like this:
Include: <path_name>

<path_name> is the relative path to the included file starting from the location
of the current file. If the path contains spaces it needs to be enclosed in
double(") or single quoutes (').

                               Lists
                               =====
When you create a test specification in HBL you will often find that you specify
a list of some kind. Examples of this include listing the accounts eligible for
betting, listing the legs in a particular race, listing the results in a race
and so on.

All lists have a similar form in HBL. The list starts out with a keyword
followed by a colon(:). After the initial keyword follows a list of items.
List items are separated by commas and a period ends the list.

Example: when defining a race day you Would define that legs 2, 3, and 4
constitutes a V3 on that particular race day.
V3: 2, 3, 4.

Below follows a few examples of how you use the Horse Betting Language.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Accounts:
  AA1      : 100,  -- Create 1 account AA1 with 100 in funds.
  AA2      : 400,
  AA[4-10] : 600.  -- Create 7 accounts AA4, AA5...AA10 with 600 in funds.

Horses:
  HH1   : 1,  -- The number is the relative ranking, if two horses have the same
  HH2   : 3,  -- rank then the start number in the race will be used as their
  HH3   : 5.  -- relative rank.

Tracks:
  Solvalla,   -- If the name of the track contains spaces they must be quoted
  "Åby",      -- otherwise quoting is optional.
  Bergsåker.

Races:
  Solvalla 2016-02-01 16:00
  V5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
  Leg 1: HH1, HH2, HH3.
  Leg 3:

RaceDays:
  Bets:
  Leg 2:
    (3, 4),
    1,
    2,
    3,
